# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM
Built a basic speech to text system using pretrained models and libraries like SPEECHRECOGINTION or Wave2vec

Here, the  model is trained in such a way that it has both the options integrated to it
such as 
1)It could read from the audio sample and there by could give the information from the given input audio sample
2)It could also listen to the live speech and can then regenerate the input
